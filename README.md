## Summary

This interactive HR Analytics Dashboard provides a dynamic view of employee turnover across various departments, job roles, demographics, and salaries. By clicking on different segments of the visualizations, you can explore how attrition rates change based on these factors. This allows HR professionals to identify trends and patterns that may be contributing to employee churn.

## Key Insights
<p>
<b> Departmental Attrition: </b> The overall attrition rate is displayed initially, clicking on specific departments (e.g., R&D, Marketing, Medical) will reveal their individual attrition percentages and potentially the number of employees who left from those departments.
  
<b> Attrition by Demographic: </b> The dashboard shows a default breakdown of attrition by factors like age group or education level. Drilling down by clicking on specific categories (e.g., 26-35 age group or Technical Degree) will provide a more granular view of attrition rates within those segments.

<b> Job Role and Attrition: </b> Similar to departments, clicking on specific job roles (e.g., Laboratory Technician, Sales Representative) will reveal the number of employees who left those positions and potentially their attrition rate.

<b> Salary and Attrition: </b> Although the initial view  showcases the attrition rate across all salary ranges, clicking on a specific salary slab would show the corresponding attrition rate for that group.
</p>

## Recommendations

Leverage the interactivity to pinpoint departments with consistently high attrition rates. Conduct exit interviews within those departments (R&D, Marketing, Medical) to gather specific reasons for employee departures.
Analyze trends within age groups and educational backgrounds. Are younger employees (26-35) or those with Medical degrees leaving for similar reasons? Clicking through the dashboard can help identify these patterns.
Investigate specific job roles with high turnover (e.g., Lab Technicians, Sales Reps) by clicking on them. Are there common themes in their exit interviews that suggest solutions like addressing burnout or providing career development opportunities?
Explore the correlation between salary and attrition by clicking on different salary ranges. Is there a specific salary band where retention seems to be a challenge?
By using the interactive features of the dashboard and then drilling down into specific areas of concern, HR can gain deeper insights and develop targeted strategies to reduce employee turnover.
